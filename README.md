The nRF52832 is [Nordic Semiconductor's](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF52832) latest multiprotocol radio system-on-chip (SoC). It's half microcontroller, with a list of features including 32 configurable I/O pins, SPI, I<sup>2</sup>C, UART, PWM, ADC's, 512kB flash, and 64kB RAM. And, it's half 2.4GHz multiprotocol radio, supporting **Bluetooth low energy** (BLE), **ANT**, and Nordic's proprietary 2.4GHz ultra low-power wireless communication -- it even features on-chip NFC tag support.

RAK815(RAK813 BreakBoard) is a wireless remote solution based on the RAK813 +
GPS + MEMS + HT+LCD design. It integrates the latest LoRaWAN 1.0.2 protocol and the
latest Bluetooth 5.0 protocol, supports LoRaWAN working mode, supports Bluetooth
transparent transmission, Bluetooth up to 300 meters away..

RAK815(RAK813 BreakBoard) built-in GPS, acceleration, temperature and humidity
sensors, expanded I2C LCD interface. We provide case applications that can configure
LoRaWAN parameters using Bluetooth, display sensor data using LCD, and upload
sensor data to the LoRaWAN network. And all the code open source. Users can find all
the open source code in github. We also designed three customizable buttons and two
customizable LED lights for our users, allowing users to implement they idea with
open-source code.

RAK815(RAK813 BreakBoard) is also a support for battery-powered products.
Greatly expanded product application scenarios. We also designed the function to enter
the low power mode when the device is detected to be stationary to ensure battery life.
The device also supports RAK831 + Ri3 gateway to use, you can graphically display the
various data of the sensor in the Cayenne platform, but also support the real-time
observation of sensor data on the phone.the breakout comes pre-programmed with a **serial bootloader**.
